    <p>Ambrosia is a personal project featuring HTML/CSS, ReactJS, and simple querying from MySQL. I didn't set out to create the next task manager, it was a project to learn lots of stuff. </p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1G9e1OfAGlXeb6e-8Oui3rOM4eEiM1Kjh" target="_blank">Research</a></strong> - I was named a 2018 Regeneron Science Talent Search Scholar. Over the span of three summers, I have learned a lot under the mentorship of Dr. Jan Plass, the researchers, and the engineers of the <a href="https://steinhardtapps.es.its.nyu.edu/create/" target="_blank">CREATE Lab</a> at NYU Steinhardt. My research titled "Executive Functions Predicting Learning Outcomes in Science and English Learning Tasks" is about the importance of executive functions in academic settings. These findings have important implications for developing a minimal expense educational curriculum to nurture the academic and long-term success of students. This research was inspired by my younger brother and those who struggle with ADHD. In this paper, I hope that you will learn of a cognitive approach to ADHD as opposed to a chemical one.
